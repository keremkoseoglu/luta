# Luta

Luta is a [Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io) based web spider / scraper.

Luta assumes that you are a Mac user and your application is executed on the foreground. That enables Luta to access HTML pages over Safari, and bypass any scraper protection on the server side.

On Safari, Develop - Allow Remote Automation should be enabled.

Here is a simple usage example:
```
from luta.crawler import Crawler

crw = Crawler("www.mysite.com")

prices = crw.get_values_between('<td class="searchResultsPriceValue">', '</div>')
for price in prices:
    print(price)

next_url = crw.get_last_value_between('<a href="', '" class="prevNextBut" title="Next"')
print(next_url)
```

Trivia: Luta means "Spider" in Sanskrit.
